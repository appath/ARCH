#### I did not invent bicycles. 

I mean there was no desire to create your own theme for Desktop

I did not steal anything.

The ```author``` of this topic is
[fs0ciety](https://fsociety.info/)

This topic is very different for Desktop

That's why I chose it!

I made small changes to this topic

Like all the authors of these works do exactly for themselves their work, or for its convenience

As I wrote in the description above I needed a theme for a personal computer and not for a laptop.

And this topic is the same time.

Pkg: 
* bspwm, sxhkd, polybar-git, tmux, urxvt-unicode, compton and feh.
