I mean there was no desire to create your own theme for Desktop

I did not steal anything.

The ```author``` of this topic is
[fs0ciety](https://fsociety.info/)

This topic is very different for Desktop

That's why I chose it!

I made small changes to this topic

Like all the authors of these works do exactly for themselves their work, or for its convenience

As I wrote in the description above I needed a theme for a personal computer and not for a laptop.

And this topic is the same time.

Pkg: 
* bspwm, sxhkd, polybar-git, tmux, urxvt-unicode, zsh, compton and feh.

```Console Palette``` [+4](https://github.com/appath/Terminal/blob/master/schemes/.terminal.bspwm).bspwm

..:Coffee Lake:..

#### On the line, I added it here, so that if something happens to a personal computer for modeling, I could quickly restore it.
#### Thank you all for your understanding.
